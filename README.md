Welcome to Week 3 of the FNB App Academy!

In Week 2 Lesson 4: Principles of UX Design, we discussed Cooking Up an App (from raw idea to ready to serve), which is a watered down term for Software Development Life Cycle. Using our case study app, Pine City Zoo, to explore how developers go from an idea to a full-fledged app. It’s all about planning, designing, and thinking ahead—just like a real dev team would. 

This week, we’ll be building our own version of the Pine City Zoo app. Some parts of it will be challenging, and that’s a good thing. You’re not just coding—you’re developing real-world skills.
